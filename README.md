### Eidos
A C bootstrapping compiler thats defined with... a *JSON* file??
Yeah so the whole language's syntax is defined via a JSON file
I meant for this to be very easy to use and it should allow you to easily made DSLs with only an understanding of C (although eidos could theoretically be easily
modified for any language)
